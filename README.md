## 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide (View Online)

If you are deploying this application to **GitHub Pages**, follow these simple steps to ensure the site builds and displays properly:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages
1. On your GitHub repository, click on **Settings** (top navigation bar).
2. In the left sidebar, click on **Pages** (under the "Code and automation" section).
3. Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, change the dropdown from `"Deploy from a branch"` to **`GitHub Actions`**.
4. That's it! Pushing to your `main` (or `master`) branch will automatically trigger `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which compiles the Vite TypeScript application and publishes the live site.

> **Why was the page blank before?**  
> 1. If GitHub Pages is set to *"Deploy from a branch (main / root)"*, GitHub attempts to serve raw uncompiled TypeScript files (`/src/main.tsx`), which web browsers cannot execute directly without building.  
> 2. Switching the source to **`GitHub Actions`** tells GitHub to run the automated build workflow that bundles the application into optimized static assets.
